# BytecodeManipulation

This project involves bytecode manipulation using Java library - ASM. The various techniques that are implemented include dead code insertion, subroutine transformation and instruction permutation. In order to test the effectiveness of the implemented techniques, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used. The model is trained using a set of files which have low level of obfuscation. Then the heavily morphed files are tested using this model. The aim is to avoid detection by HMM.
